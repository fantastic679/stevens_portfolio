# Personal Portfolio

## Rationale

This project is the start of an evolving portfolio in the form of an HTML webpage with CSS styling, initially formulated in a Coding Bootcamp homework task to utilise multiple features such as flexboxes, responsiveness to window sizes, internal page links.

Throughout the bootcamp, this placeholders for projects will be replaced with actual projects to allow this page to serve as a portfolio for job applications.

## Structure

The structure of the page is similar to that of a *Curriculum vitae* with the following subheadings (which can be updated as appropriate):

* About me;
* My work;
* Current studies;
* Qualifications;
* Contact me.

The 'My work' section is a display of multiple projects, which can be clicked up to take them directly to the project URL. These images and URLs are placeholders at this particular time. One feature of my the 'My work' section is that the first or *flagship* project is of a larger size. When the browser width is reduced below a certain threshold, the size of this project is normalised.

Another feature of this webpage is the left-sided sidebar. This features links which allows easy navigation to the corresponding subheadings mentioned above. This section with links is also *sticky*, allowing the page to be scrolled while retaining access to these links.
