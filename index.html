    <h2>About me</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Steven Phan. I am currently working as a PGY2 Resident Medical Officer at a large tertiary
        hospital in Sydney. I have recently re-discovered coding and statistics, courses that I had done
        as an undergraduate student during my Science degree. At the moment, I am currently buidling up my
        skills this this area. In combination with my domain expertise in Medicine, I feel there is a significant
        potential for contributions to both fields! See my work below for a taste.</p>
